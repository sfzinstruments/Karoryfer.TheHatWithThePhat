The Hat With The Phat is a sample library for Plogue Sforzando version 1.967 or newer. It contains samples of an oversized hi-hat made up of two ride cymbals.

To register the Sforzando bank, drag the The Hat With The Phat.bank.xml file onto the Sforzando interface. Once registered, the instrument will be available in the Sforzando loading menu and the GUI will work.

Control MIDI CC assignments:

CC4 Hi-hat position
CC80 Main volume
CC81 Down volume
CC83 Tuning
CC96 Open dryness
CC98 Closed tightness

Note assignments:

Squashed bow hit 42
Pedal chik 44
Variable (from tightly closed to open) bow hit 46
Squashed edge hit 54
Pedal splash 56
Variable (from tightly closed to open) edge hit 58
Squashed bell hit 66
Pedal return 68
Variable (from tightly closed to open) bell hit  70
Clutch drop 78
Clutch raise 80

Hi-hat position is mapped so that at value 0 it's closed, and 127 fully open - edit the SFZ to reverse this.
Down volume is the volume of an extra copy of samples pitched an octave down (but keeping the original duration).
Dryness shortens the open, splash, return and raise techniques, to emulate dry (at max extremely dry and probably cracked) cymbals.
Tightness shortens all other samples, and at max leaves only a short glitch.

Thanks to Micha³ Wêglowski for loaning the rides (and having multiple ride cymbals of the same size in the first place, which made it much easier than borrowing two cymbals from two drummers), and Adam Sobolewski for leaving a hi-hat stand at my house.
